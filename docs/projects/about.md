The Center for Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine undertakes many projects
that align with its mission. Projects can have clear end goals (e.g. moving 
to a new AWS account) or be ongoing (e.g. CBTN Data Management). 

The purpose of project pages in the handbook is to provide a central 
reference place for technical team members to understand the 
background, objectives, and organization of each project. Project pages 
won't include ongoing status or detailed project plans, but should link 
out to appropriate resources where this information can be found.

Each project page should minimally start with the following sections:

## About

Narrative description providing background and context for the project.

## Goals

This can be specific objectives for projects that have clear end goals
or longer term aims for ongoing projects.

## Organization

List the stakeholders, points of contact, units or teams responsible for 
project components. Provide links and pointers to living documents 
and communication venues such as slack channels.

## Products/Platform

List any products and platforms (both those developed by D3b and collaborators)
used by the project. This will help as we develop our product roadmap
as often projects are a starting point for determining requirements. 

Other sections can be included as appropriate, such as major deadlines
or relevant conferences, keeping in mind that it may be more appropriate
to link out if the content changes frequently.
