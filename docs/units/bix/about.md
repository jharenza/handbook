We harmonize genomics data; we analyze genomics data; we build tools for it.

### Center Methodology

![D3b methodology](assets/d3b-methodology.png)

According to the Center Methodology, we categorize our work into 3 types of
Studies: Dataset Study, Research Study and Development Study.
And hopefully we can use this mapping below to guide our work as much as
possible.

```
INFORMATION <-> Harmonization <-> Dataset Study
KNOWLEDGE <-> Analyzing <-> Research Study
Arrows Between <-> Tools/Workflows <-> Development Study
```

## Dataset Study

Studies from the DATA->INFORMATION Phase with the goal of data generating,
harmonization and portal releasing.

    Example: Kids First X01 Studies
    Data model: Kids First Dataservice Study, prefixed with SD_
    Tracking: Data tracker https://kf-ui-data-tracker.kidsfirstdrc.org/

### Research Study

Studies from the INFORMATION->KNOWLEDGE Phase with the goal of answering
scientific questions, testing research hypothesis for pedantic cancers and
structural birth defects by analyzing genomics data and making discoveries for
publications.

- Example: OpenPBTA Studies
- Data model: WIP, planned for 4-6 wks, prefixed with RS\_
- Tacking: [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10U-82xoLSyKM500yCZLETitN6Vh9prGEQzieTmhl_xc/edit#gid=0)

### Development Study

Workflow and pipeline benchmarking, development and deployment work that
support both Dataset Studies and Research Studies.
