We harmonize genomics data; we analyze genomics data; we build tools for it. 

**Center Methodology**

![](./doc/d3b-methodology.png)
According to the Center Methodology, we categorize our work into 3 types of Studies: Dataset Study, Research Study and Development Study. And hopefully we can use this mapping below to guide our work as much as possible. 
```
INFORMATION    <-> Harmonization   <-> Dataset Study
KNOWLEDGE      <-> Analyzing       <-> Research Study
Arrows Between <-> Tools/Workflows <-> Development Study
```

## 1. Dataset Study
Studies from the DATA->INFORMATION Phase with the goal of data generating, harmonization and portal releasing. 

- Example: Kids First X01 Studies
- Data model: Kids First Dataservice Study, prefixed with `SD_`
- Tracking: Data tracker https://kf-ui-data-tracker.kidsfirstdrc.org/

## 2. Research Study
Studies from the INFORMATION->KNOWLEDGE Phase with the goal of answering scientific questions, testing research hypothesis for pedantic cancers and structural birth defects by analyzing genomics data and making discoveries for publications.

- Example: OpenPBTA Studies
- Data model: WIP, planned for 4-6 wks, prefixed with `RS_`
- Tacking: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10U-82xoLSyKM500yCZLETitN6Vh9prGEQzieTmhl_xc/edit#gid=0

## 3. Development Study
Workflow and pipeline benchmarking, development and deployment work that support both Dataset Studies and Research Studies.
