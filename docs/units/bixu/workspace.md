## AWS
To access our AWS resources, you can login the Management Console within CHOP network, or via [`awscli`](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) by installing the [`aws-auth-cli`](https://github.research.chop.edu/devops/aws-auth-cli) from the internal CHOP github. `aws-auth-cli` provides a utility `chopaws` which authenticates and obtains CHOP AWS access. 
- Management Console login: http://aws.chop.edu/
- `awscli` access: https://github.research.chop.edu/devops/aws-auth-cli

The two AWS accounts listed below are our main AWS workspace, we need to choose the corresponding account based on the actual [studies/work types](https://github.com/d3b-center/bfx-orientation/wiki/Studies).
