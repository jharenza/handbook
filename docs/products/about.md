The Center for Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine has many projects with a
number of shared concerns.
To address these needs, a number of technical products have been devised which
the technical teams are responsible for developing and maintaining.
Products may take the form of applications, libraries, or tools built to
solve underlying tasks among projects.
